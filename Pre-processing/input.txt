Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players on a field at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch.
Each team takes it in turn to bat, attempting to score runs, while the other team fields.
Each turn is known as an innings.
The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman who attempts to hit the ball with his bat far enough for him to run to the other end of the pitch and score a run.
Each batsman continues batting until he is out.
The batting team continues batting until ten batsmen are out, at which point the teams switch roles and the fielding team comes in to bat.
In professional cricket the length of a game ranges from 20 overs of six bowling deliveries per side to Test cricket played over five days. 
The Laws of Cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) with additional Standard Playing Conditions for Test matches and One Day Internationals.
Cricket was first played in southern England in the 16th century.
By the end of the 18th century, it had developed into the national sport of England.
The expansion of the British Empire led to cricket being played overseas and by the mid-19th century the first international matches were being held. 
The ICC, the game's governing body, has 10 full members.
The game is most popular in Australasia, England, the Indian subcontinent, the West Indies and Southern Africa.
